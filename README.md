# Skip list

This is a skip list implemented in Lua. I've borrowed the benchmark by 
Incremental IP Limited for comparison. I've also included another skip 
list implementation by Pierre-Yves GÃ©rardy. 

The skip list performs nearly as well as the heaps, and is much faster 
than the other skip list (insertion and popping).
